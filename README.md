<B>R - Churn of Customers:</B> is a model that uses a logistic regression associated with a threshold to predict which customers present the greater risk to be lost.

<B> R- Data Cleaning + Multinomial Regression:</B> is a model that presents data cleaning and a multinomial regression using package nnet to classify customers according to their level of loyalty.

<B>R - Face Recognition:</B> is a code to detect faces and objects in R.

<B>R - Geolocation Brazil:</B> is a file for geo-spatial localization, brazilian map.

<B>R - Geolocation USA:</B> is also a file for geo-spatial localization, USA map.

<B>R - Geolocation World:</B> is a file for geo-spatial localization, world map, zoom available, customizable icons.

<B>R - Gradient Descent Logistic:</B> is a model that performs a gradient descent to define a threshold for the sigmoid function in a Logistic Regression. Boosting was implemented and ROC curves compared.

<B>R - H2O Deep Learning: </B>is a Neural Network model developed to predict recommendations and word-of-mouth advertising.

<B>R - Imbalanced classes </B> is a model for employee churn, where features have no correlation with target variable and also there are imbalanced classes in the proportion 1/20. A logistic regression from scratch is applied, a hill climbing gradient is used to define the best threshold for the logistic function and after that, boosting was compared regarding AUC in a ROC plot.

<B>Logistic Regression + Gradient Descent + Boosting</B> is a model where features have no correlation with target variable. Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent was applied, and then Boosting.

<B>R - MNIST: </B>is a solution for the MNIST dataset, developed from scratch.

<B>R - Markov Chains:</B> is a simple visualization of Markov Chains and probabilities associated.

<B>R - NeuralNet: </B>is a Neural Network model developed to predict and classify word-of-mouth advertising.

<B>R - Ridge Regression: </B> is a model with Ridge Regularization made from scratch to prevent overfitting.

<B>R - Deep Learning: </B> is a Neural Network model with 2 hidden layers for prediction of a continuous variable.
